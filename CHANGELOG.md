## 2017/11/18 Version 5.0.0


- CHANGELOG.md reformatted to CHANGELOG.rst
- Added CONTRIBUTORS.rst
- The `listeners` method no longer returns the raw list of listeners, and
  instead returns a list of unwrapped listeners; This means that mutating
  listeners on the EventEmitter by mutating the list returned by
  this method isn't possible anymore, and that for once handlers this method
  returns the unwrapped handler rather than the wrapped handler
- `once` API now returns the unwrapped handler in both decorator and
  non-decorator cases
- Possible to remove once handlers with unwrapped handlers
- Internally, listeners are now stored on a OrderedDict rather than a list
- Minor stylistic tweaks to make code more pythonic
