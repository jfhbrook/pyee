    """An event emitter class which can run asyncio coroutines in addition to
    synchronous blocking functions. For example:

    ```py
    @ee.on('event')
    async def async_handler(*args, **kwargs):
        await returns_a_future()
    ```

    On emit, the event emitter  will automatically schedule the coroutine using
    `asyncio.ensure_future` and the configured event loop (defaults to
    `asyncio.get_event_loop()`).

    Unlike the case with the EventEmitter, all exceptions raised by
    event handlers are automatically emitted on the `error` event. This is
    important for asyncio coroutines specifically but is also handled for
    synchronous functions for consistency.

    When `loop` is specified, the supplied event loop will be used when
    scheduling work with `ensure_future`. Otherwise, the default asyncio
    event loop is used.

    For asyncio coroutine event handlers, calling emit is non-blocking.
    In other words, you do not have to await any results from emit, and the
    coroutine is scheduled in a fire-and-forget fashion.
