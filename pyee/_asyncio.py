class AsyncIOEventEmitter(BaseEventEmitter):
    """An event emitter class which can run asyncio coroutines in addition to
    synchronous blocking functions. For example::

        @ee.on('event')
        async def async_handler(*args, **kwargs):
            await returns_a_future()

    On emit, the event emitter  will automatically schedule the coroutine using
    ``asyncio.ensure_future`` and the configured event loop (defaults to
    ``asyncio.get_event_loop()``).

    Unlike the case with the BaseEventEmitter, all exceptions raised by
    event handlers are automatically emitted on the ``error`` event. This is
    important for asyncio coroutines specifically but is also handled for
    synchronous functions for consistency.

    When ``loop`` is specified, the supplied event loop will be used when
    scheduling work with ``ensure_future``. Otherwise, the default asyncio
    event loop is used.

    For asyncio coroutine event handlers, calling emit is non-blocking.
    In other words, you do not have to await any results from emit, and the
    coroutine is scheduled in a fire-and-forget fashion.
