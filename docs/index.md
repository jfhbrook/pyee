# Getting Started

pyee is a rough port of
[node.js's EventEmitter](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html). Unlike its
namesake, it includes a number of subclasses useful for implementing async
and threaded programming in python, such as async/await.

## Install

You can install this project into your environment of choice using `pip`:

    pip install pyee
